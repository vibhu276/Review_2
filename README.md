COVID-19 Data Analysis Using EDA in Power BI
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 trends using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Power BI. The goal is to uncover insights about the pandemic's impact, visualize key trends, and provide an interactive dashboard for better understanding.
Dataset
- Source: Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Data
- Format: CSV
- Key Fields:
- Date
- Country/Region
- Confirmed Cases
- Deaths
- Recoveries
Objectives
- Perform EDA to understand COVID-19 trends.
- Create interactive visualizations in Power BI.
- Identify patterns and correlations in the data.
- Provide insights through storytelling.
